- [ ] Parse zip files content
- [ ] Abstract subtitle into an object so that we aren't too much tied to betaseries
- [x] Make the script download the best subtitle (if option)
- [ ] Store Subber data along with subbed files (.subber folder ? .subber_<filename>.json)
      Episode data from betaseries ?
      Elections results ?
- [ ] Treat multiple subs in one zip as variations ? What's the point, just grade them...
